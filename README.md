## 1.

My first dataset is about the chaos of college's fight songs. From [538](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fight-songs), this dataset consists of general information about the song, such as the year it was written, many Boolean variables of the content of the song, such as if it mentions rivals, and some counting variables, such as duration of the song.

Some ideas with how to perform a data analysis is to see is there a relationship between the content of the song and if the school recognizes it or not. If the song mentions a group of men such as warriors, is it more or less likely to be officially recognized by the university? Similarly, another factor that can be analyzed is if different conferences have different reasons that may lead to the origin of their fight song. Is a school from the South more likely to reference opponents than a school from the West Coast?

My second dataset, also from 538 is about trying to [quanitfy MLB reliever's statistically](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/goose). It is part of a series of articles that create a statistic called the "Goose Egg". In turn, there is a negative version of a Goose Egg called a "Broken Egg". This dataset is then used to try and rate relievers more accurately using these egg statistics than how they would be quanitified with traditional statistics.

An easy data analysis to perform on this would just be to extend the data. It would require scraping data from seasons following the 2018 season (where the data stops), but it can be calculated to see which relievers are potentially overrated or underrated by traditional stats. Another analysis that can be performed using this dataset is seeing if this stat follows what you would expect from traditional stats. You can add another column for saves and holds, traditional reliever stats and see if these follow the data.

My third dataset comes from Tidy Tuesday, and it is a dataset of [World Cup games from 1930-2018](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2022/2022-11-29). It contains data about each match, the location, day of the week, the result and more general information about the world cup as a whole, such as the top 4 teams, the location, attendance, and other relevant pieces of information. 

An analysis that I would like to do is see if there is a relationship between attendance of the tournament and the performance of the home team. If the hosting country places in the top 4, is it expected that the overall attendance was higher. What about if the hosting country was top 2, which indicates qualifying for the World Cup final. Another analysis that could be done is seeing if there are more or less goals depending on the month of the year. If a World Cup happens right before the club season, or right after the club season, or in the middle of the club season, does it lead to different goal environments at each World Cup?

My fourth dataset comes from Tidy Tuesday and it is a dataset of [March Madness data from 2008-2024](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-03-26/readme.md). It contains data about teams performance, their computer rankings and historical performance. It also contains a section saying how many people predicted a school to win a specific game.

An analysis that seems interesting would be to look if people historically trust certain schools more or less than the computers do. For example, if a school is a historic powerhouse, do people expect that team to win a game even if the computer didn't. I would like to see if there is a historical bias, either for or against certain schools, and how it may change over time.

## 5.

My fifth dataset comes from Tidy Tuesday and it is a dataset about the [Tour de France](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-04-07/readme.md). It has information about the winners of the tour, winners of individual stages, physical characteristics of the winner such as height and weight, and information on types of stages.

An analysis would be to see if a specific type of stage is more or less predictive of indicating the overall GC winner. For example, does winning a flat stage indicate winning the entire tour. Another analysis would be to see if there were general trends in the characteristics of the winner over time. For example, does the average height of a winner grow taller or shorter across decades.
